Sometime after completing my Bachelor's, I came to the realisation that I had missed the boat for a huge set of skills! Working to atleast have them now. Won't look for employement, but would definitely like to contribute to some open source projects.

Currently learning
1. Python for machine learning, neural networks, and finance
2. UiBot RPA tools
3. SQL for Mariadb.
4. Javascript
5. Golang
